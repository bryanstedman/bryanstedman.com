## What are QR codes anyway?

If you are unfamiliar with what QR codes (abbreviation for *Quick Response code*) are, they are bar codes that are scanable with a smartphone. You can think of them almost like hyperlinks for the physical world. They are cheap (read: free) to implement and anyone can use them.  The main thing about QR codes that I like, and the reason that I think that we are seeing them so much is that *they are in and of themselves a call to action. 

## What are QR codes for?

QR codes can be used to open a url, display text, add a vCard contact to the users device or compose an email or sms. I really like QR codes and am happy to see them gaining acceptance, but I do think that we need to clarify what they should and should not be used for.

This is what a QR code looks like. This one is a code that I have on my business card and you can scan it to automatically add me as a contact in your phone rather than having to manually create it and type in all the info on my card.

## **What *not* to do? **

Let’s start with what they should NOT be used for. Don’t use a QR code as the sole way to get information if it is not smartphone specific. Right now I mostly see them used to point to a url.  As [blogger][2] , Jeff Jarvis, put it in a recent [tweet][3],

> “Psst. QR codes are less convenient than URLs. Ghost of CueCat.”

He is right for two reasons. First, not everyone has a smartphone. While smartphones are everywhere, well over half of American consumers do not own a smartphone.  Using a QR instead of a standard url means that more than half the people that see it won’t be able to do anything with it. The second reason that Jarvis is right is that even those people with smartphones may find it annoying that the only way to get to the site is through a barcode. This means they can’t write it down to come back to later, they can’t tell it to a friend over the phone, they can’t even link to it.  Plus, if they don’t already has a QR code reader they have to install an app as well.

## **What *should* QR codes be used for? **

The whole idea of a QR code is to make things easier and quicker for your users.  Despite what I said in the above paragraph, I do think that pointing to a url with a QR code is fine, under two conditions. First, you provide the url written out for those of us without smartphones and second the site is optimized for mobile.  You know that your users are going to be on a mobile device when they scan the barcode so you need to be sure that they have a good experience once they get there and, despite what Steve Jobs might say, viewing a regular website on a mobile phone is not that great of an experience.

Another thing that QR codes are really good for are things that are specific to smartphones.  Jarvis mentions [CueCat][4] , and while there are obvious similarities, I would argue that QR codes are different. That difference lies not in the way the scanning works, but rather where the scanning happens.  The CueCat would be connected to the computer where as QR codes are meant for mobile. Scanning a QR code with a laptop doesn’t make sense, but we do things with our phones that we do not do (or do differently) on our PCs.  For instance having a QR code link to a mobile app is a great idea. You know that 100% of your users will have a smartphone and scanning a code is much easier than searching through an app store.
