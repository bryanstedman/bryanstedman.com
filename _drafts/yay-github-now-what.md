I was recently talking with a friend of mine about github and he expressed some confusion. I remember the first time I followed a link that led me to a github repository. I had no idea what this strange new land that I had stumbled upon was. It can be particularly intimidating if, like me, github is also your first encounter with the git versioning system. 

So you find yourself on a github page for a project that you are interested in, but then comes the questions, "What now?" Of course there is no one right answer. Each project varies for the others, but I hope that I can help to remove some of the intimdation that I felt when I first stumbled upon Github. One thing that might be a source of imtimidation is thinking that you will need to brave the command line in order to work with Github or contribute to the open source projects there. And yes, the command line is a great way to work with these repositories, it is not nessacary. So I will walk you through doing things without it. 

With that in mind
